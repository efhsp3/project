# Project Plan for Team SP3 (Shambhavi, Poornima, Priya K, Priya N)

## Brief Introduction

Our plan to demonstrate our understanding of embedded systems by implementing a household monitoring solution. 

We would like to create a small (and maybe exandable) network of sensors that could report data on the parameter they are sensing and collect this information in a centrally accessible location. 

### High Level Implementation Details

We plan to set up bluey boards with sound and dust sensors (as a measure of air quality) respectively. They will broadcast the sensor data in BLE beacons at regular intervals.

We plan to set up an Edison board that will monitor these BLE beacons and extract the sensor data from them. In addition we also plan to set up a camera that could read the meter readings from the water and electricity meters at regular intervals and also report on 

It will then store this data in a database locally or on the cloud.  

### User Benefits
As responsible citizens and homeowners, we should all be constantly congnizant of our consumption of water, electricity. We should also be aware of the quality of air and noise pollution in our homes and take necessary action if these cross acceptable limits.

A system like this could provide the user with information required to make responsible decisions about their lifestyle choices.
